The dungeon is now being invaded by a number of monsters, some of which can 
tunnel and others that cannot using their own respective distance map. 
The game now starts with the a number of monsters (specified by --nummon, default
of 10) spawning around and making their way to the player charater but he is not 
very smart and does recognize the threat. The game ends when a monster finally 
makes it to the player, but the monsters are not picky and will eat what ever they 
on land even other monsters. render_dungeon() was modified to show both types
of characters.

The monsters are stored in a heap and each take their turns to move and the dungeon 
is printed whenever it is the players turn. The heap is sorted based on next_turn,
or 1000 divided by the characters' speed. Characters are removed from the heap,
moved, and then readded to the heap.
