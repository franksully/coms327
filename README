This is a simple pong game rendered with ncurses. There is one ball and two
paddles, one on each side of the board. The ball will bounce back and forth
until it misses one of the paddles. At that point, the opposite player's score
will be incremented. The game ends at 7 points. Alternatively, the game can be
forcibly ended with the 'Q' key (shift+q). By default, the left paddle can be
moved up and down with 'w' and 's' respectively. The right uses 'u' and 'j' as
its controls if it is controlled by the player. The other options are a 1-playermode versus the AI or an AI versus AI mode.  paddle.cpp contains the class
definition for the paddles that are used and ball.cpp contains the class for the
ball.
