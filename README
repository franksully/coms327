The dungeon has two distance maps; one for non-tunneling monsters and another
for tunneling monsters. The functions dijkstra_monster_nodig() and
dijkstra_monster_dig() take one parameter (the dungeon) and modify their
respective distance maps. The maps are then printed using render_distance_1()
and render_distance_2() respectively. The distance maps are created using an
implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest distance (or
close enough to it) from the player to each valid cell on the map. If a cell for
non-tunneling monsters cannot be reached, it is instead represented with an 'X'
(see adventure.rlg327).
