The dungeon has two distance maps; one for non-tunneling monsters and another
for tunneling monsters. The functions dijkstra_monster_nodig() and
dijkstra_monster_dig() take one parameter (the dungeon) and modify their
respective distance maps. The maps are then printed using render_distance_1()
and render_distance_2() respectively. The distance maps are created using an
implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest distance (or
close enough to it) from the player to each valid cell on the map. If a cell for
non-tunneling monsters cannot be reached, it is instead represented with an 'X'
(see adventure.rlg327).



The dungeon is now being invaded by a number of monsters. Some of which can 
tunnel and others that cannot. Each using their own respective distance map. 
The game now starts with the a number of monsters spawning around and making 
their way to the player charater but he is not very smart and does recognize  
the threat. The game ends when a monster finally makes it to the player, but 
the monsters are not picky and will eat what ever they on land even other monsters. 

The monsters are stored in a heap and each take their turns to move and the dungeon 
is printed whenever it is the players turn.
