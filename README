This program parses the object and monster files then populates the dungeon
based on the rarity of each entry. Unique monsters and artifacts will only
appear once per floor, but unique monsters can reappear on subsequent floors
unless they are killed. The files object.cpp and object.h hold the class and
function definitions for the objects. The dungeon holds a separate map for where
each object is located. When a character moves over an object, it disappears
from sight, but is rendered again when the character moves to a different space.
Currently, each monster only displays its first color when not concealed.
