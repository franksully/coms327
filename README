This program improves upon the combat system and allows the picking up and
equipping of items. The do_combat() function of move.cpp was modified so that
the monsters will swap places instead of killing each other. Additionally, the
monsters and pc will roll for damage against the other character's hit points.
Items are automatically picked up off the ground, but must be manually equipped
to have any effect on combat. Items can boost damage, hitpoints, speed or any
combination of all three. Items can be equipped, unequipped, inspected, dropped,
and expunged. Monsters can be inspected in order to view its description. The
game ends when a monster with the boss attribute is killed or when the pc dies.
