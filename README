The file_save() function will save a file to a specific path. The contents of
this file are in line with the specifications of the pdf file. The file_load() 
function will load from the same place that the file is saved. The flags are
-s or -save and -l or -load respectively. The place_pc() function will place a 
player character in a valid location. The player is a struct type with two
variables for their location. The dungeon struct stores the player inside
its definition. The render_dungeon() function was modified to also place an '@'
char at the location where the player should be. Currently, there must be a
file present in order to load. The file must be in the path specified in main().
