Array table[][] holds a series of nodes that make up the dungeon. Array rooms[]
holds structs for the room information. Function prototypes, struct definitions,
and #define directives are located in the dungeon.h header file. initDungeon()
initializes the rooms, ensuring they are within bounds and not overlapping.
initTable() sets the status of the structs based on rooms. initCorridor()
connects each room via a series of corridors. Stairs are placed at the end and
can be in rooms or corridors.
