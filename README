Most of the code has been converted from C to C++. The structs that were in the
previous versions have been changed into classes. A 5x5 fog of war has been
added around the player. This can be toggled on and off by pressing 'f'. The fog
map continues to update even when viewing the fog of war is disabled. However,
the map is cleared upon proceeding to another floor. The pc can also teleport by
pressing 'g'. The pc can teleport into walls, but cannot proceed past the border
surrounding the dungeon. update_fog() updates the fog map and io_teleport_pc()
lets the user move the pc.
