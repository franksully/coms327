This program generates a dungeon with a certain number of monsters. The player
character is able to move in all eight directions or wait on the current space.
The player cannot tunnel through walls, but some of the monsters do not have
this weakness. Most of the game is run through the game_loop() function using
ncurses to display the map. Pressing 'm' displays a list of monsters and their
relative location to the player. The list_loop() function allows scrolling
through the list if there are too many monsters to fit on the screen. Using
stairs creates a new dungeon with a new batch of monsters. Previous dungeon
floors are not saved. The screen is initialized using io_init_terminal() and is
cleared at the end of the program (after pressing 'Q').
